2. The mRNA nano-particles (active ingredients) are coated with PEG. The development of auto-antibodies to polyethylene glycol (PEG) will not only make the vaccine less effective but may cause allergic reactions with deadly adverse events.  

Why is this potential for serious harm not listed in your leaflet as a possible side effect? What scientific evidence does MHRA have that deems PEG safe for injection which is not the same as it being eaten?

3. The vaccines also contain mNeonGreen, an ingredient not listed in your leaflet. This has bio-luminescent properties. 

Why is this ingredient, taken from marine invertebrates, being used in the vaccines? 

4. Why does your leaflet not make it clear that the vaccine will not prevent recipients from being infected with SARS CoV-2 thus becoming infectious? 

5. The American NIH published a list of potential ADRs that includes Guillain Barre Syndrome, Transverse Myelitis, Encephalitis, Stroke, Arthritis and even Death among other conditions. 

Does the MHRA have evidence that such side effects will not occur? If not, why do these do not appear in your leaflet? 

6. Is the MHRA not aware that the approach of vaccinating people with experimental mRNA vaccines violates the precautionary principle, which requires that a medical intervention be proven safe before being released. How can the omission of extended trials deem them safe?  

7. If it is known that the product may cause harm, and especially death, in advance and is still released without the public being fully informed of these risks, does this not constitute an egregious violation of the medical ethical principles established through the Nuremberg Code in order to prevent human rights violations? 

8. if recipients are vaccinated without knowing the potential side effects, how can they give their “informed consent”?

9. It s understood that the Pfizer/BioNTech trial did not include anyone over the age of 55 and anyone with co-morbidities. 

Why is it therefore deemed appropriate to vaccinate the over 80s first; most of whom will have at least one co-morbidity when the risks to them are unknown? (If this is a political question it may be more appropriate to ask the DHSC rather than the MHRA).",07/01/2020,Disclosed in full
